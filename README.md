# Welcome to CDX (Colins Design (E)Xperience)

## Usage

Until now, CDX uses React TSX components. For using it follow these steps:

For testing in React Web:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/thuner2007/cdx.git
```

```sh
cd cdx
npm i
npm start
```

When you want to use a component in your own project, you have to copy the component from the cloned repo and paste it in your project.
